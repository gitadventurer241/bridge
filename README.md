# Bridge Project ‚ÄúEmpowering Underrepresented Groups in Switzerland‚Äú (from SHIFT4)


## Our Vision üî≠
Bridge is a nonprofit, comprehensive platform dedicated to empowering underrepresented communities to land a great tech job in Switzerland. Our mission is to equip them with the essential tools, resources, and unwavering support needed to secure jobs in the dynamic tech industry. Through innovation and inclusivity, we aim to bridge the gap between the skills of these communities and the demands of the Swiss tech job market, ultimately fostering integration, self-sufficiency, and economic independence. 

At Bridge, we envision a future where underrepresented communities in Switzerland harness their skills, gain meaningful employment within the tech sector, and contribute not only to their personal success but also to the prosperity of the Swiss economy. Our platform embodies the principles of diversity and innovation, paving the way for a brighter future for both the targeted communities and the Swiss tech industry.
